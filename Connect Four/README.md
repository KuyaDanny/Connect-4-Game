# Overview

For this file I am working on getting a working connect 4 game to work.
The way to play this game is simple, there are two players with player 1 getting to go first. 
Player 1 will select an option between 0-6 representing the columns where you can place your
first piece. Once player 1 has chosen then it will go to player 2. The objective is to get 4
of your pieces in a row whether it be diagonal, vertical, or horizontal.
